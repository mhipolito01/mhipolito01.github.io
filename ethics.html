            <h2>IT-Related Ethics: Workplace Surveillance</h2>
            <p>
                With the rise of digital tools and remote work environments, workplace surveillance has become more commonâ€”and more controversial. 
                From monitoring employee computer activity to tracking location via mobile devices, these practices raise ethical questions about 
                privacy, trust, and power dynamics. While employers have legitimate reasons for oversight, ethical workplace surveillance 
                requires clear boundaries and respect for individual rights.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Ethical Considerations for Workplace Surveillance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Being transparent:</strong>
                    <p>Employees must be clearly informed about any monitoring taking place. This includes the type of surveillance, its purpose, and how the data will be used.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Define clear purpose:</strong>
                    <p>Monitoring should be directly tied to specific, legitimate goals such as data security, compliance, or productivity. Surveillance for vague or overly broad purposes can lead to misuse.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Track only what is necessary:</strong>
                    <p>Systems should be designed to collect only what is necessary. Overly invasive practices, like monitoring private messages or off-hour activities, violate ethical boundaries and employee rights.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
